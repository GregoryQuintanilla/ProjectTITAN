This is the repository for Hofstra University's Computer Science Software Engineering Course were our team is creating a fleet routing service.

To get the repo please type 'git clone https://github.com/GregoryQuintanilla/ProjectTITAN.git' in the desired folder you want to store teh project on your personal machine.

I reccommend if you are not familiar with git repos to look at some tutorials to get yourself comfortable.
